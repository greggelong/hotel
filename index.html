        Gracie Art hotel is an inspiring place to do an artist residency. The
        hotel itself and the wonderful staff and its location all make a
        profound impact on an artist or guest. The staff is helpful and
        friendly. And the hotel services and facilities are wonderful. The
        hotel’s décor is a window to all forms of art and culture. An eclectic
        works of art hang in every part of the hotel. Some of which have been
        created in the prior residences. The residency facilitates a community
        of artists. An example is David Lane’s Art/Work workshop. The hotel in
        that way becomes a living self reflective entity with a growth learning
        and growing with each artist that comes. The location of the art hotel
        in Beijing’s 798 art district allows easy access to the best of Chinese
        and international contemporary art. My artwork focuses on the
        intersection of technology, philosophy, science and culture. I use
        computer code, electronics, kinetic sculpture and painting techniques
        and materials. You can see the impact that the hotel had on me through
        my ideas and code sketches and sculpture elements.

          This innovative shower, aptly named the Reflection Shower, aims to
          transcend its utilitarian purpose and elevate the act of cleansing
          into an experience of profound self-discovery and mental clarity. The
          shower uses cutting-edge quantum purification technology, in which
          water molecules are infused with nanomaterials with reflective
          properties. As these nanomaterials flow through your body, they not
          only clean up physical impurities, but also trigger a profound
          introspection that symbolically washes away the myriad possibilities
          of who you are.

          Harnessing the captivating illusion of infinite reflection found
          within the strategically placed bathroom mirrors of the hotel, the
          Infinity Mirror is a mesmerizing exploration of endless recursion.
          This optical phenomenon is expertly captured and simulated through an
          innovative online application developed with JavaScript, alongside an
          immersive installation piece displayed on a screen controlled by a
          Windows computer. Both the app and the installation meticulously
          recreate the mesmerizing effect of the infinity mirror, inviting
          viewers to lose themselves in the illusion of boundless repetition.
          Beyond its visual allure, the concept of infinity embedded within the
          Infinity Mirror serves as a poignant reminder of the profound depths
          of the unknown. It challenges our perceptions and understanding,
          compelling us to confront the vastness of existence and the potential
          insignificance of the individual self within the infinite expanse of
          possibility. Through this exploration, the Infinity Mirror prompts
          introspection and contemplation, inviting viewers to grapple with the
          enigmatic nature of infinity and its implications on our perception of
          reality.

          Foam Robot Guest offers a whimsical exploration of the dynamic
          relationship between technology and humanity, posing intriguing
          questions about the future of our coexistence. Amidst concerns about
          the potential dominance of technology and the rise of artificial
          intelligence, Foam Robot Guest takes a lighthearted approach to
          envisioning a world where foam-based automatons occupy spaces
          traditionally reserved for humans. Their soft, unassuming forms exude
          playfulness and charm, challenging us to reconsider our perceptions of
          technological advancement and its implications for society. Through a
          kinetic sculpture employing servos, sensors, and microcontrollers,
          this work breathes life into the concept of foam robots as
          unconventional guests within the hotel space. Accompanied by a video
          showcasing these endearing robots in various hotel settings, viewers
          are invited to contemplate the possibility of harmonious coexistence
          between humans and their technological counterparts. Foam Robot Guest
          serves as a thought-provoking exploration of the potential futures
          that lie ahead, sparking conversations about the evolving relationship

        Microscopic Message is a captivating sculptural textile installation
        that offers a unique exploration into the intricacies of the minuscule
        world. Utilizing a handheld microscope, this piece delves into the realm
        of near-microscopic patterns found within items and guests' belongings
        within the hotel room. By magnifying these minute details, Microscopic
        Message unveils a hidden tapestry of patterns that might otherwise go
        unnoticed. These intricate patterns hold the potential to be translated
        into textile prints, offering a tangible connection between the
        microscopic and the human scale. Imagining these patterns adorning a
        bedspread and pillowcase brings the micro-world into the realm of
        everyday life, allowing us to engage with it in a tangible and
        meaningful way. Through this exploration of the infinitesimal,
        Microscopic Message invites viewers to contemplate their place within
        the vast expanse of the universe. It prompts reflection on how our daily
        experiences, thoughts, and choices are shaped by the microscopic
        processes unfolding within us, whether in the intricate workings of our
        brains or the complex code of our DNA. In unraveling the mysteries of
        the microscopic world, Microscopic Message offers a profound perspective
        on the interconnectedness of all things, reminding us of the profound
        significance embedded within even the smallest of details.

          Bit Works Bit Works offers a thought-provoking exploration bridging
          the realms of biology and technology, revealing the fundamental role
          of binary code in our modern digital landscape. At its core, Bit Works
          delves into the underlying deterministic systems present in both
          biological processes and technological advancements. From the
          intricate workings of biological systems to the digital tools we
          interact with daily, everything boils down to the manipulation of
          bits—ones and zeros—that form the foundation of modern computing. One
          facet of Bit Works manifests through sculptural installations,
          featuring colorful boxes arranged in a grid. These boxes encode an
          8-byte pattern derived from a conversion of the artist's room number
          and dates of stay. This fusion of personal data with digital
          representation not only serves as a visual manifestation of the binary
          nature of technology but also blurs the lines between the physical and
          digital realms. Accompanying this sculptural component is a Wolfram
          cellular automaton visualization of Rule 210, showcasing the
          deterministic yet unexpectedly complex structures that arise from
          simple computational rules. This visualization will be accessible both
          as an online application developed using JavaScript and as an
          installation piece displayed on a screen equipped with a camera,
          controlled by a Windows computer. Through Bit Works, viewers are
          invited to contemplate the intricate interplay between deterministic
          systems, digital representation, and emergent complexity, prompting
          reflection on the profound implications of binary code in shaping our
          understanding of the natural and technological world.
