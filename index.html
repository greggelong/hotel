        Gracie Art hotel is an inspiring place to do an artist residency. The
        hotel itself and the wonderful staff and its location all make a
        profound impact on an artist or guest. The staff is helpful and
        friendly. And the hotel services and facilities are wonderful. The
        hotel’s décor is a window to all forms of art and culture. An eclectic
        works of art hang in every part of the hotel. Some of which have been
        created in the prior residences. The residency facilitates a community
        of artists. An example is David Lane’s Art/Work workshop. The hotel in
        that way becomes a living self reflective entity with a growth learning
        and growing with each artist that comes. The location of the art hotel
        in Beijing’s 798 art district allows easy access to the best of Chinese
        and international contemporary art. My artwork focuses on the
        intersection of technology, philosophy, science and culture. I use
        computer code, electronics, kinetic sculpture and painting techniques
        and materials. You can see the impact that the hotel had on me through
        my ideas and code sketches and sculpture elements.

          This innovative shower, aptly named the Reflection Shower, aims to
          transcend its utilitarian purpose and elevate the act of cleansing
          into an experience of profound self-discovery and mental clarity. The
          shower uses cutting-edge quantum purification technology, in which
          water molecules are infused with nanomaterials with reflective
          properties. As these nanomaterials flow through your body, they not
          only clean up physical impurities, but also trigger a profound
          introspection that symbolically washes away the myriad possibilities
          of who you are.

        <p>
          Harnessing the captivating illusion of infinite reflection found
          within the strategically placed bathroom mirrors of the hotel, the
          Infinity Mirror is a mesmerizing exploration of endless recursion.
          This optical phenomenon is expertly captured and simulated through an
          innovative online application developed with JavaScript, alongside an
          immersive installation piece displayed on a screen controlled by a
          Windows computer. Both the app and the installation meticulously
          recreate the mesmerizing effect of the infinity mirror, inviting
          viewers to lose themselves in the illusion of boundless repetition.
          Beyond its visual allure, the concept of infinity embedded within the
          Infinity Mirror serves as a poignant reminder of the profound depths
          of the unknown. It challenges our perceptions and understanding,
          compelling us to confront the vastness of existence and the potential
          insignificance of the individual self within the infinite expanse of
          possibility. Through this exploration, the Infinity Mirror prompts
          introspection and contemplation, inviting viewers to grapple with the
          enigmatic nature of infinity and its implications on our perception of
          reality.
